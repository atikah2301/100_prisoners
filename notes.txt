dictionary that randomly maps 1 to n boxes to 1 to n slips (key value pairs)

prisoners are numbered 1 to n. 
all prisoners will follow the strategy of:
1. start by choosing the box with their number k 
2. then choose the box with the same number as the slip in the previous box
3. repeat until 
	you end up finding the slip k which leads you back to the first box k (success)
	OR
	you have checked n/2 boxes (failure)
4. if you failed, stop the experiment, since the experiment is a failure.
5. repeat for each prisoner until 
	one prisoner fails
	OR
	all prisoners succeed
6. if all n prisoners succeed, then the experiment is a success.

there are n! mappings, but for each mapping there are n which are identical "chains" of mappings when you considere the loop strategy. so this gives n!/n = (n-1)! ways for a chain of length n to form. 

the loop strategy derives a partitioning for the set of all boxes/slips i.e. a set of subsets of the boxes whose union forms the parent set and whose intersection is the empty set.

we want to know 
probability that the largest of these subsets has cardinality 50
= P(L<=50)
= probability of all prisoners being able to find their slip in 50 tries or less
= probability of having a successful episode.

if there are n boxes and n slips, then the probability of there being a chain of maximum length k, i.e. P(L=k) is 1/k
so, P(L<=l) = sum of all 1/k for k=1 to k=l, which can be thought of as an integral of 1/k with respect to k, bounded from 1 to l. this is simply ln(x) for x>=`1
